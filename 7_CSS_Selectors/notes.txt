The World of CSS Selectors
==========================

->  CSS Rules
    ->  Everything you do in CSS follows this basic pattern:
        selector {
            property: value;
        }
->  We can select tags ranging from elements to inputs 

->  Universel select:
    ->  Selects Everything!
        * {
            color: black;
        }

->  Element selector:
    ->  Selects all elements of the same type

->  Class Selectors
    ->  Selects elements that have the same class name
    ->  Selects elements with the class name:
        .complete {
            color:green;
        }

->  Descendent selector
    ->  Selects elements nested inside another
    ->  Select all <a>'s that are nested inside an <li>
        li a {
            color: teal;
        }
