CSS: The Very Basics
====================

What is CSS
-----------
->  What is it?
    ->  CSS is a language for decsribing how documents are 
        presented visually - how they are arranged and 
        styled.

->  What does it stand for?
    ->  CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. We'll cover the
        "cascading" part in a bit;
        
->  There's a lot!
    ->  CSS is very easy to get the hang of, but it can be
        intimidating because of how many properties we can
        manipulate.

CSS Rules
->  (almost) everything you do in CSS follows this basic pattern:
    selector {
        property: value;
    }
    
-> Make all <h1> elements purple
    h1 {
        color: purple;
    }

-> Make all image elements 100 px wide & 200 px tall
    img {
        width: 100px;
        height: 200px;
    }

-> Select every other text input and give it a red border:
    input[type="text"]:nth-of-type(2n){
        border:2px solid red;
    }


Including Styles Correctly
--------------------------
->  Inline Styles
    ->  You can write your styles directly inline on each element,
        but this is NOT A GOOD IDEA most of the time.

-> The <STYLE> Element
    ->  You can write your styles inside of a <style> element.
        This is easy, but it makes it impossible to share styles
        between documents.
    ->  NOT RECOMMENDED EITHER

-> External Stylesheet
    ->  Write your styles in a .css file, and then include the
        using a <link> in the head of your html document.
    ->  Recommended!
